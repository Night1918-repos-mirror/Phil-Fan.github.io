## day2 - learning goal
In the short term, my learning goal is to prepare for the IELTS exam. Setting a specific target for improving my spoken English is challenging since it is difficult to measure accurately. However, my aim is to have fluent conversations with others and speak with an authentic accent.

Regarding vocabulary enhancement, I have been using Momo, an online vocabulary learning application, to help me memorize words. I highly recommend this app to others who want to expand their vocabulary.

In the long run, I am also determined to enhance my communication skills and logistical abilities. Meeting individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds has been incredibly inspiring and has motivated me to work on these aspects of my language abilities.

If I make any mistakes, please let me know directly. Thank you.

## day3 - favorite food
Hey everyone, today I'm talking about my top grub â€“ Sichuan hot pot. It's not your usual meal; think of it as a taste explosion that lights up my taste buds.

Sichuan hot pot is all about flavors. The broth's amped up with Sichuan spices and peppercorns, giving my mouth a tingly ride. You dunk meats, veggies, and tofu in the pot, give 'em a quick cook, and then dip 'em in awesome sauces. It's like a flavor party in your mouth!

But it's not just about the food. Picture this: you and your pals around the pot, cooking and chatting. The laughs, stories, and bonding â€“ it's like making memories while you eat.

To sum up, Sichuan hot pot is my thing. It's not just food; it's a blast of flavors and a way to make memories with friends. Hot or cold outside, you bet I'm down for some Sichuan hot pot. 
Thanks for tuning in


## day4 best friend
Hey everyone! I wanna share a quick story from back in the day, about my buddy Adam.

We were city kids, you know? Our thing was hitting the park right after school. Swings, slides, you name it. We practically lived there, soaking up every bit of fun.

And get this â€“ we'd stroll home together too. Just shooting the breeze, talking about everything and nothing. Those walks were golden.

But you know where the real action was? Our school's playground. Man, we'd kick that soccer ball like there was no tomorrow. Laughing, competing, and learning about teamwork along the way.

Life took us different places eventually, but the memories stuck. The bond we built, the laughter we shared, it's all part of who I am today.
Catch you later, and thanks for listening!

## day 5 tea or coffee

Hey everyone, let's chat about coffee, my morning fuel. Those 8 AM classes? Yeah, they're tough. Coffee steps in like a reliable friend. One sip and suddenly, eyes open, brain awake. tea's cool, but when you need a real jolt, coffee's the answer. 

It's not just about caffeine; it's the comforting smell, that warm mug in hand. And coffee shops? They're like cozy havens, where me and my cup get ready to face the day.

Whether it's black, latte, or cappuccino, coffee's there to tag along. It's not just a drink; it's a morning handshake.

So here's to coffee â€“ the quiet cheerleader for sad university students like me. Cheers!

And you know what's cool? Soccer's a friendship builder. On the field, you're not just playing; you're bonding. Whether you're defending or scoring, you're part of a team.

## day 9 my favorite song

My absolute favorite song? Oasis' "Don't Look Back in Anger." 
First time I heard it is the halftime break during a soccer match, and instantly this song starts. The stadium transforms into this massive choir.

The song's like a time machine, taking me back to that instant. My brother and I instantly fell in love with the mix of deep lyrics and an uplifting beat.

Sadly, I've never caught the original live performance, but that doesn't matter. This song's etched into my life, reminding me that music's a powerful connector. It's the magic that brings people together, no matter where you are
